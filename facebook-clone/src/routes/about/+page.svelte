<h1>Who Are We?</h1>
<p>
    Here at Not Facebook, we pride ourselves on our extreme unoriginality
    and blatant rehashing of a well known company. We're here to offer you the experience of a social media 
    platform that, while being almost identical to what you're used to, assures 
    you that we have a "totally different" identity. At Not Facebook, we believe 
    in the power of imitation â€“ because why be original 
    when you don't have to? So, go ahead, create your account, and remember,
    imitation isn't just flattery; it's the foundation of our social network
</p>


<h1>What We Do</h1>
<p>
    Well, we do everything Facebook does, just not quite. At "Not Facebook," we
     specialize in the art of being not quite Facebook. We bring you the latest in 
     status updates, photo sharing, and even those mysterious friend requests, but
      with a subtle twist of uniqueness. Our mission is to provide you with a platform
       that's familiar yet refreshingly different. You can connect with friends, share 
       your life's moments, and browse your news feed, just like you would on that other
        platform...but not. We embrace the subtle irony of being "Not Facebook" by offering
         you a space that feels like Facebook, only with a bit more quirk. So, whether 
         you're tired of the same old or just fancy a change that's not too drastic, "Not 
         Facebook" is here to offer you the "not-quite-the-same" social media experience you 
         never knew you wanted. Join us in the quest for a Facebook that's not quite Facebook but
          still something entirely unique!
